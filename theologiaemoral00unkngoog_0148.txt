134 DE CONTRACTUS NATURA.

Nominatus dicitur contractus cui nomen speciale in lege datur, v: g ε
venditi0‚ locatio, societas: innominatus qui speciali caret nomine.
Quatuor species contractuum innominatorum recensentur, scilicet, do
ut dee, do ut facias, facio ut des, facio utsacias.²

2. Nudus dicitur contractus si duo ita inter se conveniant, ut nulla
actio civilis inde oriri queat: talis est omnis contractus innominatus,
antequam ex altera parte sit impletae, nisi accedat formula stipula-
tionis, juramentum, vel aliud hujusmodi. Omnis contractus qui re
perficitur est nudus ante rei traditionem. Jure communi omnis con-
tractus qui aequa consideratione non nititur nudus est? Vestitus
dicitur contractus si aliquod habeat juris firmamentum quo actionem
civilem pariat. Firmamenta juris sunt scriptura, stipulatio, testae,
juramentum, conjunctio contractus innominati cum nominate. Com-
muni jure contractus scripto et sigillo munitus specialis dicitur; si
sigillum desit, dicitur verbalis, licet scripto fiat.³ Si contractus sit
postea executioni demandanduS, dicitur Anglice in actione positus 3

(1) “ These valuable consideratione are divided by the civilians into four
species. 1. Do, ut des: as when 1 give money or goods, on a contract that Ι
,shall be repaid money or goods for them again. Of this kind are all loans of
money upon hond, or promise of repayment3 and all sales of goods, in which
there is either an express contract to pay so much for them, or else the law
implies 8 contract to pay so much as they are worth. 2. The second species ie,
facio ut facias ‚· as when 1 agree with a man to do his work for him, if he will
do mine for me; or if two persons agree to marry together, or to do any positive
acts on both sides. Or, it may be, to sorbeat on one side on consideration of
something done on theother, as, that in consideration A, the tenant, will repair
his house, B, the landiord, will not sue him for waste. Or, it may be for mutual
forbearance on both sides ς as that in consideration that Ἀ, will not stade to
Lisbon‚ B will not uada to Marseilles3 so as to avoid interfering with each other.
3. The third species of consideration is facio ut des .· when a man agrees to
perform any thing for a price, either specifically mentioned, or left to the determi-
nation of the law to set a value to it. . . 0 4. The fourth species is, do ut sacius.-
which is the direct counterpart of the preceding. As when I agree with a servant
to give him such weges upon his performing such work : which we see is nothing
else but the last species'inverted ε for vservu-⁴3 facit, ut herus det, and herus dat,
ut servus faciat-'' Blackstone's Comm. l. ii. n. 445.
(2) ‘⁴ A contr-act without a consideration is a nudum pactum, and not binding
in law.'’ Kent's Comm. vol. ii. part. v. lec. xxxix. n. 464.
(3) ‘⁴ The agreement is either under seal, or not under seul. If under seal, it
ie denominated a specialty, and if not under seal, an agreement by par013 and the

latter includes equally verbal and written contracte not under seal.” Ibidem. n.
450.
