(1) ‘⁴ In one particular instance the wife 'may acquire a property in some of
her husband’s goods: vvhich shall remain to her after his death, and not go to his
executore. These are called her paraphernalia, which is a term horrowed from
the civil law, and is derived from the Greek lang-uage, signifying something over
and above her dower. Our law uses it to signify the apparel and ornaments of
the wife, suitable to her rank and degree3 and therefore, even the jewels of a
peeress usually worn by her, have been held to be paraphernalia. These she
becomes entitled to at the death of her husband, over and above her jointure or
(lower, and preferably to all other representatives. Neither can the husband
devise by his will such ornaments and jewels of his wife.'' thckstone's C'omm.
l. ii. n. 436.

(2) ‘⁴ The separate property of the wife is divided into dotal, being that which
she brings to the husband to assist in the marriage establishmenu and extra-dotal
or paraphemal property, being that which‘ forms no part of the dowry. The
husband is the head and master, and the proceeds of the dowry belong to the
husband, during the marriage.'' Kent’s Gmnm. vol. ii. part iv. lec. xxviii. Sic
apud Gallos paraphernalia habentur omnia uxoris bona in dotem non constituta.
