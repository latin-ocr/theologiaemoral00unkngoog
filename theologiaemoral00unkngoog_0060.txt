46 DE DOMINIS.

patris committuntur custodioe3 et quoe labore acquisiverit, poterit
pater etiam sibi vindicare, nisi filio e domo dimisso, visus sit liberam
ei facere facultatem suam operam locandi. Attamen quae seorsim a
patre acquisiverit arte propria, vel commercio peculiari, licet in do-
mo paterna, filii omnino sunt, juxta codicem (Ξὶεῌίωιιη.1 Filius -qui
vigesimum primum annum aetatis expleverit, sui juris est.5¹ Poterit
idcirco exigere mercedem pro labore, nam ‘⁶ pietatem liberi parenti-
bus, non operas debent.”³ Ante illam aetatem quaestio est apud
theologos, utrum filius possit exigere vel subtrahere mercedem ob
operam specialem patri haud indigenti praestitam. Lessius, De
Lug0, Cabassutius aliique affirmant 3 contradicentibus Laymann, An-

, toine, Billuart, aliisque. Negantibus assentimur, quum ita serat lex

civilis, et aequum videatur ut alimenta donaque a patre praestita
merces habeantur. Creterum si constet aliquem e filiis patri suas
praestitisse operas, dum caeteri suis studerent utilitatibus, non videre-
tur teneri ad restituendum quae in sui mercedem bona fide sustulit,
ni forsan modum plane excesserit.⁴

(2) “ A father has no other power over his son’s estate than as his trustee or
guardiam for though he may receive the profits during the child's minority, yet
he must account for them when he comes of age. He may indeed have the
benefit of his children’s labour while they live with him, and are maintained by
him.” Blackstone Comm. l. ri. n. 453. “ In G'ale v. Par-rou, it was obser-ved,
that if the minor was elo'igned from the parent, he might, of necessity, be enti-
tled to receive the fruits of his own labour‚ and that it would require only slight
circumstances to enable the court to infer the parent's consent to the son's receipt
and enjoyment of his own wages. . . A father may, by agreement with his minor'
child, relinquish to the child the right which he would otherwise have to his ser-
vices, and authorize those who employ him to pay him his own earnings. . .
The son, in such cases, may make a valid special contract with his employer.”
