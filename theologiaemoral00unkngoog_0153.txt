DE CONTRAOTUS NATURA. 139

dare, si nullam habuerit intentionem contrahendi, pretium tamen ac-

ceptum restituat oportet. Quod si venditio coram tribunali probetur,

frustra plerumque allegabit se animo contrahendi· caruisse, nisi ex
adjunctis plane pateat.

8. -E'rror vel dolus circa rei substantiam, vel qualitatem quae in
substantiam redundat, consensui obstat, quippe qui eirca ignotum non

versatur.¹ Hinc si quis acetum pro vino, vitrum pro gemma vendat,
contractus nullus est. E contra si error respiciat qualitatem accidenta-
lem, contractus valet, saltem nisi error ei causam dederit, adeo ut, er-
rore sublat0‚ contractus initus non fuisset.² Quapropter qui vinum
aliud pro alio emit, absque ulla vendentis fraude, tenetur plerumque
contractu. Si vendentis dolo contigerit ut vinum aliud emptori daretur,
poterit hic contractum rescindere, et pecuniam suam repetere ε ven-
ditor autem fraudis sibi conscius teneturad compensandum damnum,
si vinum vilius majori pretio dederit.³

9. Error in demonstratione, si respiciat substantiam aut personam,
vitiat contractum: secus si sit circa accidentia.⁴ Hinc si quis 'alteri

agros vendat quos uterque censet agris quos jam possidet alter adja-
cere, contingat autem alios agros describi instrumento, nullus erit

(1) “ It would seem ιο be sound doctrine, that a substantial error between the
parties concerning the subject matter of the contract, either as to the nature of
the article, or as to the consideration, or as ιο the security- intended, would de-
stroy the consent requisite to its validity.” Kent’a Comm. vol. ii. part v. lec.
xxxix. 471.

(2) “ By the civil code of Louisc’ana, art. use-2519, a redhibitory action is
provided for the avoidance of a sale, on account of some vice or defect in the
thing sold, which rendere it either absolutely useless, or its use so inconvenient
and imperfect, that it must be supposed that the buyer would not have purchased
it, had he known of the vice-’⁹ Ibidem, Note.

(4) ‘⁴ If the object of the contract be present, an error in the name does not
vitiate it; as, if A, gives a horse to C, (D being presenn) and says to him, (C‚)
D, take this horse, the gift is good notwithstanding a mistake in the name3 for
the presence of the grantee gives a higher degree of certainty to the identity of
the person than the mention of his name. So, if the error consiste in the de·
monstration, or reference, and not in the name of the thing, — as if A, grant to
B, his lot of land called Dale, in the pai-ish of Β., 111 the county of D„ and the
lot lies in the county of Η., yet the falsity of the addition does not effect the
efficacy of the contract. Many other cases ιο the like effect are put by Lord
Bacon‚ and given by way of iuusn-ation of the rule, that praesentia corporis tollit
errorem uminis, et veritas nominis tollit murem aemma-strationis? Ibidem,
556.
