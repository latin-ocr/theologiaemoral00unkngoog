desumpta est3 nam dicit S. Joannes. ‘ Si quis venit ad voe, et hanc
doctrinam non affert, nolite recipere eum in domum, nec Avi: ei

(2) Cap. viii. de sent weom- in 6. “With us by the common law an ex-
communicated personis disabled to do any act, that is required to be done by
one that is probus et legalis homo. He cannot serve upon-juries, cannot be a
witness in any court, and which is the worst of all, cannot bring an action either
real or personui, to recover lands or money due to him. ι N or is this the whole:
for if within forty days aster the sentence has been published in the church, the
offender does not submit and abide by the sentence of the spiritua] court, the
bi-hop may certify such contempt to the king in chancery. Upon which there
issues out a writ to the sheriff of the county, called from the bishop' s certificates
a sjgmficavih or ἧσαι its effects a writ de &communicato capiend0,· and the
sheriff shall thereupon take the offender, and imprison him ια’ the county gaol,
till he is reconciled to the church, and such reconciliation certified by the bishop;
under which another writ dc excommunicato, deliberando‘ issues o'ut of chancery
to deliver and release him.” Blackston. Comm. 1. iii. n. 102. ·

(5) I. Cor. v. 11. Animadvertit Bloomfieldius: Μηδὲ συνεσὲίερν may be ex-
plained with the best commentators, ‘to hold no familiar intercourse‚' . . . . com-
munity of table being a figure expressive of intimacy. See Luke xv. 2. Gal
ii. 12. This was meant to strengthen the efficacy of excommunication, and,
under certain circumstances, to supply its place.” In locum.
