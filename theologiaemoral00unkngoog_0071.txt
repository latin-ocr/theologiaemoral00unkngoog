DE MODIS ACQUIRENDI DOMINIUM. 57

53. Pisces qui in mari versantur, vel in fluminibus quoe navigari
possunt, etin quae aestus maris ferun, capientibus cedunt:¹ sed in
fluviis minoribus jus piscandi plerumque servatur vicinis riparum
dominis,² qui et retia quibus includantur saepe jaciunt. Qui igitur
pisces ex retibus auserunt, injuriam, quam compensare debent, faci·
unt dominis. Caeterum in Pennsylvania fluvii majores habentur
communes, adeo ut omnibus jus piscandi in iis vindicetur.³ Legi-
bus Pennsylvaniae et Delavariae jus piscandi in flumine Delavarensi
regitur, mulctis gravioribus impositis iis qui absque licentia piscan-
tur, vel die dominica, vel temporibus quibusdam anni. Sic et lex
Status Delavariae licentiam piscandi exigit, et poenas alienigenis
aliisque absque venia piscantibus imponit.⁴

54. Animalia cicurata ex feris, ut cervi, pavones, columboe domes-
ticae, si consuetudinem redeundi amiserint, pristinam libertatem recu-
perasse censentur, ideoque fiunt occupantis :⁵ e contra si soleant
adhue redire, manent domini. Hinc columbae nequeunt absque in-
‘justitia a columbario quod frequentant ad alienum allici fraude et
artificio, laqueis vel aliis hujusmodi adhibitis. Quod si quis eibum
-meliorem in suo columbario reponat, vel illud in loco opportuniori
statuat, utitur jure su0.

· (l) ‘⁶ The right of fishing in navigable water-s, is founded on such plain prin-
ciples of natural lavv, that it is considered by many jux-ists as part of the law of
nations.” Kent's Gomm. vol. ιιι. part vi. lec. lii. n. 413.

(2) ‘⁴ It was a settled principle of the common law, that the owners of lands
on the banks of fresh water rivers, above the ebbing and flowing of the tide,
had the exclusive right of fishing‚ as well as the right of property opposite ιο
their respective lands adfilum medium aquas-’⁹ Ibidem, ιι. 411.

(3) ‘⁶ In Pennsylvania, the English doctrine that no rivers are deemed navi-
gable, so as to give the common right of fishing, except those where the tide
ebbs and flows, has been held not to be applicable to the great rivers in that
state, and that the owners of land on the banks of such rivers as the Susque-
hanna and Delaware‚ for instance, have no exclusive right of fishing in the rivers
opposite their respective lands. The right to fisheries, in such rivers, is declared
to be vested in the state, and open to all the world; and a similar exception to
the rule of the common law has been suggested to exist in South Carolinass’
ιι. 418.

liberty and ferocity without the ani mus νεηνίεω the property in them cesses-’⁹
