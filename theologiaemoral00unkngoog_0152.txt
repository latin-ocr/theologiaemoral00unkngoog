138 DE CONTRACTUS NATURA.

6. contrahere nequeunt amentes‚¹ vel qui mente adeo sunt imbe-
cilli ut contractus vim et naturam haud norint.5¹ Quod si perpetua
amentia non laborent, per lucida inter-valla valent contrahere. Si
quis ex curiaesauctoritate declaratus sit amens, omnes ejus contractus
deinceps censentur nullius momenti, nisi certis testimoniis constet
eum rationis usum recuperasse. Ei qui amenti merces vendit, quin
norit amentiam, tribunalia favent.³ Ebrii nequeunt contrahere,
quandocumque non norunt quid oneris contrahendo sibi inducunt.
Nonnumquam ebriosis tollitur facultas contrahendi, et tota bonorum
suorum administratio alteri committitur!⁵

§. ΙΙΙ. QUI varen· consensus.

7. consensus duorum verus et liber ad contractus valorem exigi·

haud teneri dicunt; fatentur tamen eum debere damnum reparare
quod ex ejus fictione alter passus sit. Tribunalia autem civilia et
ecclesiastica consensum adfuisse praesumunt, quoties exterius profe·

equum valde generosum vili vendat pretio, haud tenebitur‘ equum illi

necessary to have the real estate of an infant sold, there must be a guardian es-
pecially appointed for that purpose, and the sale is made under the direction of
the court of chancery, and the application and disposition of the proceeds are to
be under its order, for in respect to such proceedings, the infant is considered a
ward of the court.” Kent's Gomm. vol. ii. part iv. lec. xxx. n. 228.

(1) “ The contracts of lunatice are generally void from the period at which the
inquisition finds the lunacy to have commenced. But the inquisition is not
conclusive evidence of the fact, and the party affected by the allegation of ‚lunacy
may gainsay it by proof, without first trever-sing the inquisition.’' Ibidem. vol.
ii. part v· lec-xxxix. 1.

(2)· “ Imbecility of mind is not sufficient to set aside a contract, when there is
not an essential privation of the reasoning faculties, or an incapacity of unde*-
standing and acting in the ordinary affairs of life. This incapacity is now the
test of that unsoundness of mind which will avoid a deed at law.’' Ibidem, 452.

(3) “ In the case of Βατείας v. the Earl of Porlsmoutlt. . . . . the inquisition
of lunacy was not admitted to form any defence, on the ground that the goods
firmished by the tradcsman were suitable to the condition of the defendant, and
that he had no reason to suppose that the defendant was a lunatic.” Ibidem.

(4) ‘⁴ A contract made by a person sc, destitute of reason as not to know the
consequences of his contract, though his incompetency be produced by intoxica-
tion, is void-’⁹ Ibidem.
